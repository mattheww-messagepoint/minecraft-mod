### Notes

- Ensure trade block is added to player's starting inventory for testing (via event handler)
- Make sure trades are balanced according to the 10-25% efficiency gain guideline
- Prevent any cyclical trades that could result in infinite resource generation
- Test in both single player and multiplayer environments
