# CR002 - Product Requirements Document: Pet Growth System

## Introduction/Overview

The Pet Growth System is a Minecraft mod feature that introduces a cute, interactive creature designed to appeal to young players, especially girls around age 12. Players can nurture and care for their pet, which will grow through four distinct stages. Growth is achieved by providing food, water, and occasional treats, with each stage unlocking new appearances, abilities, and interactions. The system aims to foster engagement, responsibility, and fun through pet management and progression.

## Goals

1. Provide a fun, engaging pet-raising experience for young players.
2. Encourage regular player interaction through care mechanics (feeding, watering, treats).
3. Visually and functionally evolve the pet across four growth stages.
4. Offer clear feedback and management tools for pet status and needs.
5. Ensure the system is accessible and enjoyable for moderately experienced child players.

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to feed and water my pet so that it grows and becomes more capable.
- As a player, I want my pet to look cuter and gain new abilities as it grows.
- As a player, I want to use a feeder to provide food and water for my pet.
- As a player, I want to give my pet treats to help it grow faster.
- As a player, I want to toggle my pet between following me and staying in place.
- As a player, I want to mount my pet when it is large enough.
- As a player, I want to place my pet in a cage and store it in my inventory.
- As a player, I want to see my pet’s status and needs in a simple interface.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must introduce a new, cute pet entity with four growth stages.
2. The pet must require regular feeding and watering to progress to the next stage.
3. The system must include a treat item that accelerates pet growth when used.
4. The pet’s appearance, size, and abilities must change at each growth stage.
5. The pet must be able to follow or stay based on player input (toggleable state).
6. The pet must be mountable by the player at later growth stages.
7. The pet must be able to eat and drink from a custom feeder block/item.
8. The pet must be placeable in a cage item/block, allowing it to be stored in inventory.
9. The system must provide a status/management UI showing pet needs and growth progress.
10. The system must support one pet per player, with persistent state across sessions.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. The system will NOT include advanced AI behaviors beyond following, staying, and mounting.
2. The system will NOT support pet trading or multiplayer pet sharing.
3. The system will NOT include breeding or multiple simultaneous pets per player.
4. The system will NOT require or provide custom art assets within this PRD (art to be created externally).

## Design Considerations

- The pet should have a cute, appealing design suitable for young girls (age 12 target).
- Growth stages should be visually distinct and rewarding.
- The status UI should be simple, colorful, and easy to understand.
- Consider using Blockbench or similar Minecraft modeling tools for art asset creation.
- The feeder and cage should be visually themed to match the pet’s style.

## Technical Considerations

- The system should be implemented for Minecraft Forge 1.21.5.
- Pet state (growth, needs, follow/stay) must persist between sessions.
- The feeder and cage should be custom blocks/items with simple inventory logic.
- The UI should be accessible via right-clicking the pet or a dedicated item.
- Consider extensibility for future pet types or additional interactions.

## Success Metrics

1. Players regularly interact with their pet and progress through all growth stages.
2. Positive feedback from target users (children, especially girls) regarding fun and engagement.
3. The pet’s needs and growth mechanics are clear and easy to manage.
4. No major bugs or confusion reported in playtesting.

## Open Questions

1. What specific creature design will be used for the pet? (To be determined with art tools)
2. What are the exact requirements (number of feedings, time, etc.) for each growth stage?
3. What abilities or features are unlocked at each stage?
4. Should the pet have any special effects or sounds as it grows?
5. How will the player be notified if the pet is hungry or thirsty?
6. Should there be consequences if the pet is neglected?
